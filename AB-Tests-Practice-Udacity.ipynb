    "\n",
    "-  At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". <br>\n",
    "-  If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.\n",
    "-  If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",

    "\n",
    "-  In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course.\n",
    "-  If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free.\n",
    "-  At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. [This screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByAfiG8HpNUMakVrS0s4cGN2TjQ/view) shows what the experiment looks like.\n",

For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page. __[Click here to find out more about cookies and internet tracking](https://robertheaton.com/2017/11/20/how-does-online-tracking-actually-work/)__"

Thus with our experimental 'B' \"treatment\", we wish to achieve at least a $1\\%$ improvement to $0.21625$. Moreover, with a Type I error of $\\alpha = 0.05$ (probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis) and Type II error of $\\beta = 0.2$ (probability of accepting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is true) we want to conduct an experiment with sufficient sample size to reject $5\\%$ of true null hypotheses $H_0: P_{exp} - P_{cont} = 0$, and accept $20\\%$ when the alternative hypothesis $H_1 : P_{exp} - P_{cont} = d$ is true.\n",

(1) We determined the minimum sample size that would yield a 95% test of the null hypothesis and that also had a 20% of failing to detect a change in the alternative wof d=+1%. According to our sample size calculations, we needed a minimum of $509,100$ cookies in pageviews in order to achieve $509,100*0.08/2 = 20,364$ CTA's in each of the control and experimental groups. As noted earlier, if our sample numbers exceed $20,364$ the effective precision of the experiment can only be improved. (2) Our one sided test of the null hypothesis (GC_exp - GC_cont = 0), given a pooled standard error of $GC_exp - GC_cont$ of GC_ME = 0.72% is: Accept $H_0$ if $z\\_score \\le 0.72\\%$, and Reject $H_0$ if $z\\_score > 0.72\\%$. (3) Since $-2.06\\% < 0.72\\%$ the null hypothesis is accepted, so we conclude that there is a low probability the experiment improves the Click-through-probability. But $-2.06\\% < 1.0\\%$, the minimum practical improvement that would be acceptable. Therefore we find no evidence fin favor of switching to the experimental method, at least on the Gross Conversion metric. Apparently, the precommitment (5 hours per week) dissuaded about $2\\%$ of those who would have otherwise enrolled, an exceedingly bad result."
